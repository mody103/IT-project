      <h1>FERRARI DAYTONA SP3 A SPORTS PROTOTYPE SOUL</h1>

      <p>
        At the 1967 24 Hours of Daytona, Ferrari took the top three places in
        the first round of the International World Sports Car Championship. The
        330 P3/4, 330 P4 and 412 P that famously shot past the chequered flag
        side by side perfectly encapsulated the spirit of the sports prototypes
        of the 1960s, a decade now considered the golden era of closed wheel
        racing. The Ferrari Daytona SP3, the second car to join the limited
        edition Icona series, pays homage to the mid-rear-engined Ferrari V12
        sports prototypes that earned the marque its unparalleled motor sport
        status.
